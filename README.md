# lead_poisoning

Here is some preliminary analysis that I put together to examine and predict lead poisoning risk in children NYC and New York State.

A summary of the analysis and data sources can be found in the following blog:

## The analysis was completed in two IPython Notebooks:

*Note: Be sure to change the "rootpath" in the notebooks, if necessary.*

NYC Lead Poinsoning.ipynb (this analysis was done first, so please look at this one first.)

NY State County Lead Poisoning.ipynb

## The python package requirements are listed in the following file:

## The full list of the data sources I used is here:

#### NY State BLL data:

#### American Community Survey 2014 tool for data extraction:

#### American Community Survey geographical shapefiles for NYC zipcodes and NY State counties:

*Note: The zipcode shapefile is included in the data directory but the county shapefile was too large to upload to github. This will need to be downloaded by the user to their local repo.*
