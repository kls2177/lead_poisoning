# lead_poisoning

This is code that I put together to examine lead poisoning in children NYC and New York State for a data challenge.

A detailed summary of the analysis and data sources can be found in the following blog:

http://kls2177.github.io/lead/

## The analysis was completed in two IPython Notebooks:

NYC Lead Poinsoning.ipynb (this analysis was done first, so please look at this one first.)
NY State County Lead Poisoning.ipynb

## The python package requirements are listed in the following file:

requirements.txt

## The full list of the data sources I used is here:
